## 🔹 Q1. Explain Public & Enterprise Wi-Fi

### 📡 Overview:
**Wi-Fi** is a wireless communication technology enabling devices to connect to the internet using radio waves. Based on the deployment environment, Wi-Fi is categorized into **Public Wi-Fi** and **Enterprise Wi-Fi**.

### 🌍 Public Wi-Fi:
- **Deployment:** Open spaces like malls, airports, cafes.
- **Access Control:** Minimal or no authentication.
- **Security Protocols:** Often lacks WPA2/WPA3; vulnerable to attacks (e.g., MITM, rogue APs).
- **QoS:** Unmanaged, no traffic prioritization.

### 🏢 Enterprise Wi-Fi:
- **Deployment:** Offices, educational institutions, organizations.
- **Authentication:** Secured via RADIUS, 802.1X, or identity-based systems.
- **Security Protocols:** WPA3-Enterprise, VPN enforcement, segmentation.
- **QoS:** Traffic shaping, bandwidth control, VLANs.

### 📊 Comparative Table:

| Parameter        | Public Wi-Fi 🌐     | Enterprise Wi-Fi 🏢       |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Authentication   | None/Basic          | 802.1X, SSO, LDAP          |
| Encryption       | Optional (WPA)      | WPA3-Enterprise, TLS       |
| Management       | Unmanaged           | Centrally managed (Controller-based) |
| Use Case         | Customer access     | Employee and secure IoT    |

## 🔹 Q2. Explain the Evolution & Layers of IoT

### 📈 Evolution of IoT:
IoT has evolved from basic **sensor networks** to an intelligent **edge-cloud hybrid architecture** supporting real-time data analytics and AI-driven automation.

#### 📅 Key Phases:
1. **Sensor Networks (2000s)** – Basic data capture.
2. **M2M Communication** – Device-to-device via protocols like MQTT, CoAP.
3. **Cloud IoT (2010s)** – Centralized processing & data storage.
4. **Edge IoT & AIoT (Present)** – Real-time edge computation, AI-enhanced devices.

---

### 🧱 IoT Architecture Layers:

1. **Perception Layer (Edge Devices)**  
   - Sensors, actuators, RFID
   - Responsible for data collection from physical world  
   - Example: Soil moisture sensors in agriculture

2. **Network Layer (Data Transmission)**  
   - Transfers data over LPWAN (LoRa), Wi-Fi, Zigbee, 5G  
   - Ensures data integrity and routing  

3. **Middleware Layer (Platform)**  
   - Edge nodes or cloud platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub)  
   - Performs processing, filtering, and rule-based routing

4. **Application Layer (UI/UX & Services)**  
   - User interface and business logic  
   - Examples: Smart homes, wearable health devices, predictive maintenance

## 🔹 Q3. What are the Requirements of Inelastic Traffic?

### 🔁 Definition:
**Inelastic traffic** refers to data flows that are delay-sensitive and bandwidth-specific. Such traffic **cannot tolerate variations in latency or jitter**, making QoS essential.

### 📌 Requirements:

- **Low Latency (<150 ms)**: Essential for real-time responsiveness.
- **Low Jitter (<30 ms)**: Prevents packet delay variations.
- **Consistent Throughput**: Requires bandwidth reservation.
- **Error Tolerance**: Minimal; packet loss leads to quality degradation.
- **QoS Enforcement**: Uses DiffServ, MPLS for traffic prioritization.

### 🎯 Use Cases:
- VoIP (SIP-based calls)
- Real-time video conferencing (WebRTC)
- Live online gaming (UDP-based traffic)

### 📘 Technologies Used:
- **DSCP Marking**
- **802.11e (WMM for Wi-Fi)**
- **QoS-aware SDN Policies**

## 🔹 Q4. What are the Elements of Routers?

### 🌐 Modern Router Architecture:

| Element           | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **Control Plane** | Executes routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP), makes path decisions. |
| **Data Plane**    | Forwards packets using control plane info (based on routing/forwarding table). |
| **Management Plane** | Handles router configuration, CLI/GUI/REST API access. |
| **Routing Table (RIB)** | Stores best routes selected by routing protocols. |
| **Forwarding Table (FIB)** | Optimized table for fast packet lookup used by data plane. |

### 🧠 Key Components:

- **CPU** – Executes router OS and control logic.
- **RAM/NVRAM** – Stores volatile and startup configurations.
- **Interfaces** – Physical (Ethernet, Fiber) or logical (VLAN, VPN).

### 🔧 Examples:
- Cisco ISR (Integrated Services Router)
- MikroTik Cloud Router Switch

## 🔹 Q5. Explain with Diagram – Autonomous System Diagram

### 📌 Definition:
An **Autonomous System (AS)** is a collection of IP networks and routers under a common administrative domain that uses a single routing policy.

### 🌐 Routing Context:
- **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP):** OSPF, EIGRP (within AS)
- **Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP):** BGP (between ASes)

### 🧭 Diagram Representation:

```
        [AS 100 – ISP A]
        ┌───────────────┐
        │     Router A   │
        └──────┬────────┘
               │ BGP
        ┌──────▼────────┐
        │     Router B   │
        └───────────────┘
        [AS 200 – ISP B]
```

### 🔄 Functionality:
- Routes are exchanged via **BGP-4** across AS boundaries.
- Each AS is assigned an **Autonomous System Number (ASN)** by IANA.

## 🔹 Q6. Explain with Diagram – High-Level NFV Framework (Page 353)

### 🧱 What is NFV (Network Function Virtualization)?
NFV decouples network functions from proprietary hardware, running them as **Virtual Network Functions (VNFs)** on standard servers.

### 🔄 Key Components of NFV Architecture:

1. **NFV Infrastructure (NFVI)**  
   - Physical and virtual resources (CPU, storage, switches)

2. **VNFs (Virtual Network Functions)**  
   - Software-based firewalls, NAT, routers

3. **MANO (Management & Orchestration)**  
   - Lifecycle management of VNFs using tools like **OpenStack, ETSI MANO**

### 🔧 Example Use Case:
Instead of installing a physical firewall device at every branch, a telco deploys a **vFirewall** as a VNF for all branches remotely.
